# Optimized V5 Configuration
# Based on empirical analysis of winning vs losing trades
# Key improvements:
# 1. Hedge ratio filter (0.5-2.0) - avoids directional bets
# 2. Higher entry z-score (2.5) - better quality entries
# 3. Dynamic max holding based on half-life
# 4. Prefer balanced hedge ratios in scoring
