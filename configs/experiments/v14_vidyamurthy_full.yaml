# V14 - Full Vidyamurthy Framework Implementation
# 
# Based on Vidyamurthy "Pairs Trading" Chapters 6-7:
# 1. SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) filter - measures cointegration quality
# 2. Zero-Crossing Rate filter - measures tradability
# 3. Time-based Stop Tightening - "passage of time = increase in risk"
# 4. Updated scoring with Vidyamurthy metrics
#
# Building on V11 (Crisis-aware) which had $2,079 PnL

# ==========================================================================
# NEW: Vidyamurthy Framework Parameters
# ==========================================================================
# SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio): σ_stationary / σ_nonstationary
# Higher SNR = stronger cointegration (mean-reverting vs noise)
# Typical good values: 1.5-3.0+
min_snr: 1.5

# Zero-Crossing Rate: number of times spread crosses mean per year
# Higher ZCR = more tradeable, faster mean-reversion
# Typical good values: 5-20 per year
min_zero_crossing_rate: 5.0

# Time-based Stop Tightening
# Vidyamurthy insight: "mere passage of time represents increase in risk"
# As holding exceeds half-life, stop tightens to protect capital
time_based_stops: true
stop_tightening_rate: 0.1  # Stop tightens 10% per half-life elapsed

# Capital & Risk Management
